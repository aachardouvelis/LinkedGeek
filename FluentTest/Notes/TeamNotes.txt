Problem reguarding making Developer and Company unrelated (no parent class User)
	1 - they have many common features:
		posts - Contact Info - Address

		The problem is that they can't be the same class because (a) the ContactInfo of company is a bit different from the contact info
		of Developer,

		(b) A Company Address is the same with a Developer Address so they can possibly share the same class. The same goes for Posts.
		A tricky situation arises
